# Autonomous Multi-Agent Workflow

How to design agent pipelines where multiple specialized agents collaborate on a task without human intervention between steps. Covers orchestration patterns, data handoff, failure handling, and cost control.

---

## When to Use Multi-Agent

Single-agent execution is the default. Reach for multi-agent only when:

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Task spans multiple domains | Architecture audit + test review + security scan |
| Subtasks have independent inputs | Lint scripts in parallel across modules |
| Expert depth exceeds one prompt | Compose UI specialist + accessibility specialist |
| Output of one agent feeds another | Scout finds context → Planner designs → Worker implements |

If one agent can do the job in a single context window, one agent is better. Multi-agent adds latency, token cost, and failure surface.

---

## Agent Topology

### Chain (Sequential Pipeline)

Each agent's output feeds the next. Use when tasks have data dependencies.

```
Scout  ──→  Planner  ──→  Worker  ──→  Reviewer
  context      plan         code        verdict
```

**Implementation** (GSD subagent chain):
```
subagent chain:
  - agent: scout,   task: "Map the auth module structure"
  - agent: planner, task: "Design OAuth migration using {previous}"
  - agent: worker,  task: "Implement the plan from {previous}"
```

`{previous}` is replaced with the prior agent's output automatically.

**When to use**: Research → plan → implement → review pipelines.

### Fan-Out / Fan-In (Parallel)

Independent subtasks run simultaneously. Results are collected and merged.

```
         ┌─ Agent A (module-1) ─┐
Input ──→├─ Agent B (module-2) ─┤──→ Aggregator
         └─ Agent C (module-3) ─┘
```

**Implementation** (GSD subagent parallel):
```
subagent parallel:
  - agent: test-specialist,  task: "Review tests in core/domain"
  - agent: test-specialist,  task: "Review tests in core/data"
  - agent: ui-specialist,    task: "Review Compose screens in feature/home"
```

All three run concurrently; results return when all complete.

**When to use**: Same check across independent modules, parallel audits.

### Orchestrator (Wave-Based)

A coordinator agent dispatches waves of work, collects results, and decides what runs next. The `/full-audit` orchestrator is the canonical example.

```
Orchestrator
  ├─ Wave 1: Scripts (fast, free)     ──→ findings[]
  ├─ Wave 2: Agents (focused, paid)   ──→ findings[]
  ├─ Wave 3: Cross-cutting agents     ──→ findings[]
  └─ Deduplication + Report
```

**When to use**: Complex workflows where later waves depend on earlier results, or where cheap checks should gate expensive ones.

---

## Agent Design Rules

### 1. Single Responsibility

Each agent owns one domain. An agent that does "architecture review AND test generation AND security scanning" will do all three poorly. Split into three agents.

### 2. Typed Contract

Define the input/output contract explicitly in the agent's frontmatter or system prompt:

```yaml
# Input: path to module root, coverage threshold (percentage)
# Output: structured findings as JSON between FINDINGS_START/FINDINGS_END markers
```

Structured output enables machine parsing. Free-form prose blocks aggregation.

### 3. Read-Only by Default

Agents report — they don't modify code unless explicitly designed to. A `test-specialist` that finds gaps should list them, not auto-generate tests. A separate `auto-cover` agent handles generation.

This separation prevents conflicting writes from parallel agents.

### 4. Graceful Degradation

Use the [capability detection pattern](capability-detection.md) for optional tools. An agent that requires Context7 but gets invoked without it should fall back to training knowledge, not crash.

### 5. Bounded Context Window

Each agent starts with a clean context. It receives only:
- Its system prompt (the `.md` file)
- The task description (from the orchestrator)
- `{previous}` output (in chain mode)

It does NOT inherit the parent's conversation history, open files, or tool state. Design agents to be self-sufficient: they discover what they need via `read`, `rg`, `lsp`.

---

## Data Handoff Patterns

### Structured Markers (Agent → Aggregator)

```markdown
<!-- FINDINGS_START -->
[
  {"severity": "HIGH", "file": "AuthViewModel.kt", "line": 42, "title": "CancellationException swallowed", "category": "error-handling"},
  {"severity": "MEDIUM", "file": "LoginScreen.kt", "line": 18, "title": "Missing contentDescription", "category": "accessibility"}
]
<!-- FINDINGS_END -->
```

Aggregator extracts JSON between markers. Everything outside markers is human-readable narrative.

### Severity Convention

| Level | Meaning | Blocks release? |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `BLOCKER` | Broken functionality, data loss risk | Yes |
| `HIGH` | Security issue, crash risk | Yes |
| `MEDIUM` | Code smell, missing coverage, pattern violation | No |
| `LOW` | Style, naming, minor improvement | No |
| `INFO` | Observation, context for other findings | No |

### Prose Fallback (Agent → Human)

When an agent produces unstructured output, the orchestrator falls back to line-pattern parsing:

- `[BLOCKER]`, `[CRITICAL]`, `[ERROR]`, `[FAIL]` → HIGH+
- `[WARNING]`, `[WARN]` → MEDIUM
- `[OK]`, `[PASS]` → skip

Always prefer structured markers. Prose fallback exists for resilience, not as a design target.

---

## Failure Handling

### Agent Timeout

Set timeouts per agent. If an agent exceeds its budget, the orchestrator:
1. Records the timeout as a finding (`severity: INFO, title: "Agent X timed out"`)
2. Continues with remaining agents
3. Never retries automatically — timeouts usually indicate a scope problem

### Agent Crash

If an agent errors out (tool failure, API error):
1. Capture the error message
2. Record as a finding (`severity: MEDIUM, title: "Agent X failed: {error}"`)
3. Continue — one agent's failure should not abort the pipeline

### Partial Results

A chain where step 2 fails: the orchestrator reports steps 1 and 3 (if independent) and marks step 2 as failed. Fan-out collects whatever completes.

**Anti-pattern**: Retrying a failed agent with the same input. If it failed once, it will likely fail again. Surface the failure and let a human decide.

---

## Cost Control

### Wave Gating

Run free checks (scripts, grep, file-existence) before paid checks (agents). If Wave 1 finds blockers, skip Wave 2+. The `/full-audit` profiles implement this:

| Profile | Waves | Estimated cost |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| `quick` | 1–2 | ~$0.05 |
| `standard` | 1–3 | ~$0.30 |
| `deep` | 1–4 | ~$1.00+ |

### Token Budget per Agent

Agents should declare `token_budget` in their design. An agent that needs 50K tokens of context is doing too much — split it.

### Script-First Principle

Before creating an agent for a check, apply the [script vs agent decision framework](script-vs-agent-decision.md). If a regex can do it, a regex should do it.

---

## Example: Full Audit Pipeline

The `/full-audit` skill demonstrates the complete pattern:

```
Wave 1 (scripts, free, ~10s)
  ├─ pattern-lint.sh        → grep-based pattern violations
  ├─ verify-kmp.sh          → source set validation
  └─ rehash-registry.sh     → registry integrity

Wave 2 (focused agents, ~30s, ~$0.10)
  ├─ test-specialist         → coverage gaps
  ├─ ui-specialist           → Compose patterns
  └─ doc-alignment-agent     → doc/code drift

Wave 3 (cross-cutting agents, ~60s, ~$0.15)
  ├─ cross-platform-validator → feature parity
  ├─ release-guardian-agent   → release hygiene
  └─ privacy-auditor          → PII in logs

Aggregation
  ├─ 3-pass deduplication (exact → proximity → category rollup)
  └─ Consolidated report with severity counts
```

## Creating a New Multi-Agent Workflow

1. **Define the problem** — what decisions need multiple viewpoints?
2. **Choose topology** — chain, fan-out, or orchestrated waves?
3. **Design each agent** — single responsibility, typed contract, read-only
4. **Define the handoff** — structured markers between agents
5. **Set failure policy** — timeout, crash handling, partial results
6. **Gate by cost** — free checks first, expensive checks gated
7. **Test in isolation** — each agent should work standalone before wiring into a pipeline
8. **Wire the orchestrator** — subagent chain/parallel, or a dedicated orchestrator agent
